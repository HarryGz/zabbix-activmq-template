# Zabbix template for ActiveMQ

This Zabbix template can be used to monitor ActiveMQ. Features:

- Autodiscovery of brokers
- Autodiscovery of queues

This template is based on the [template by armahan](https://github.com/armahan/zabbix-templates/blob/master/ActiveMQ/ActiveMQ-JMX-Discovery-Template-3-4.xml), adapted and updated to work with Zabbix 4.2 and ActiveMQ 5.14.3.
